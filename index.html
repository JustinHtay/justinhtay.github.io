        <p>
        That's a good question! My name is Justin Htay. I'm a third-year double major in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I specialize in bringing together the <b>theoretical</b> and the <b>practical</b>. I combine a strong background in mathematics, especially in combinatorics and probability, with a wealth of experience in coding, design, and electrical engineering fundamentals. I've worked extensively with Linux systems, bash scripting, and Python coding. I'm a passionate teacher and work as an undergraduate teaching assistant with the College of Computing at Georgia Tech, teaching an introduction to programming course in MATLAB.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, you'll find that I have a love for history, and can often be found nose-deep in a history book or simulating it in a video game. I keep my wits sharp with a game of chess and my body healthy with a long bike ride. Music is a big part of my life and I'm most relaxed on a piano bench or singing in Chorale. I carry on my cultural heritage through a love of cooking and food.

                    I currently work as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (<b>UTA</b>) for the College of Computing at Georgia Tech, teaching <b>CS 1371</b>, which is the introductory programming class for most engineering students at Georgia Tech. We have over 1000 students enrolled in the class in the larger semesters. As a TA, I have:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Served as <b>Course Manager and Homework Lead</b> concurrently for two summer semesters. As Course Manager, I was responsible for smooth operation of the class, managing the TA team, and communicating with the professor who taught the class. As Homework Lead, I published weekly homeworks for the class.</li>
                            <li>Wrote 20+ homework problems that were both creative and instructive for students.</li>
                            <li>Taught 1.5-2 hour recitations and held 3 hours of office hours weekly for a section of approximately 50 students.</li>
                        </ul>
                    I have worked as a TA from January 2017 until the present.

                    I worked as a High-Performance Computing (<b>HPC</b>) co-op in the Advanced Concepts Laboratory (<b>ACL</b>) of the Georgia Tech Research Institute (<b>GTRI</b>). I was responsible for maintaining and upgrading 10+ HPC resources and performed numerous electromagnetic modeling tasks. Highlights of my time at GTRI include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Applying <b>numerical optimization</b> techniques (e.g <b>genetic algorithms</b>) to design electromagnetic structures using the <b>FDTD</b> method</li>
                            <li>Designing a fragmented aperture antenna that was produced using a novel 3D-printed approach that resulted in a paper.</li>
                            <li>Designing a Frequency Selective Surface (<b>FSS</b>) for use in a novel periodic structure. My designs were important in getting the project extended a year with additional funding.</li>
                            <li>Installing 5 major ACL computing resources on <b>Linux</b> operating systems (both <b>RHEL</b> and <b>Ubuntu</b>) and managing 5+ other resources, extensively utilizing my knowledge of Linux, <b>bash</b>, and problem-solving techniques.</li>
                            <li>Creating a dashboard using <a href="https://grafana.com">Grafana</a> to display ACL achievements and user statistics on the clustering resources to prospective customers.</li>

                    I worked at GTRI from January 2017 to August 2018.

                    The National History Bee and Bowl (<b>NHBB</b>) organizes quiz competitions for middle and high school students around the globe on primarily historical content. Thanks to my experience in <a href="#">Academic Bowl</a> and love of history, I am a seasoned writer of questions. At NHBB, I:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wrote 800+ questions with a 99% acceptance rate. These questions were used in all levels of competition, from local tournaments to the International History Olympiad.</li>
                            <li>Wrote 40%+ of a set on short notice, which is a very high proportion for a single writer. For my efforts, I was recognized by the Director for Question Production for outstanding contributions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    I have worked at NHBB from May 2015 to the present.
